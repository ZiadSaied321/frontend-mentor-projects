### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project.
media querys is not only used for responsive design but also used for printing and more so it's an important concept in css

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    .container {
        height: 90vh;
        width: 80%;
        margin-left: 10%;
        margin-top: 5%;
    }
}
```
